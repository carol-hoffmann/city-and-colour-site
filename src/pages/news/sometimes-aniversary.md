In 2025, Dallas Green celebrated the 20th-year anniversary of his debut album, Sometimes. To celebrate, he did a few concerts playing the whole album. This tour to celebrate Sometimes was originally planned to happen in 2020; I even got tickets to go see him in Brazil, but when COVID happened the whole tour got cancelled.

A few words said by Dallas about what the album means to him: “When we released Sometimes 20 years ago, I could never have imagined the journey it would take me on. But more importantly, how deeply the songs would resonate with so many people. This night is a celebration of that connection and for everyone who has spent time with this record over the years. These songs became yours a long time ago. As always, thank you for listening.”

One of the concerts was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on October 18th. I was planning to go, but I had exams for the first semester scheduled for the 19th. It's still my dream to see him live someday.
