City and Colour has reimagined his debut record Sometimes in the form of lullabies. This new iteration of the record, called Sometimes Lullaby, is out Friday (November 28) via Dine Alone.

The album was originally a COVID project of Dallas Green's, and is now seeing the light of day to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Sometimes. It's an apt addition to his catalogue, considering noughties emos are now at child-rearing age.

"We wanted to remake ‘Sometimes’ into a dreamy little lullaby album for brand new City and Colour fans….and longtime ones who just want the world to slow down a little." says Dallas Green.

Sometimes Lullaby will be available digitally and on special edition vinyl for Record Store Day Black Friday. The album — as well as some limited edition merch — will be available online on City and Colour's website starting November 28 at 10 a.m. ET. Records can be purchased in person at the Dine Alone Store on the same day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
