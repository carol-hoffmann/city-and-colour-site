excerpt: "City and Colour has reimagined his debut record Sometimes in the form of lullabies."
---

City and Colour released a lullaby version of his debut album Sometimes, and I thought it was such a sweet idea. The new version is called Sometimes Lullaby and it came out on Friday, November 28, through Dine Alone. Apparently, Dallas Green first worked on this during the COVID years, and now he’s finally putting it out to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original record. I thought it was such a cool idea, since so many people grew up listening to this album and now have kids of their own.

Dallas said that the idea was to turn Sometimes into a dreamy lullaby album, both for new listeners and for longtime fans who just want things to slow down a bit.

The album is available digitally and as a special edition vinyl for Record Store Day Black Friday. There is also some limited merch online and the vinyl is also being sold in person at the Dine Alone Store.
