Tash Sultana has teamed up with Canadian singer-songwriter City and Colour for a new collaboration, lifted from their forthcoming EP Return to the Roots.

The third single, “Ain’t it Kinda Funny”, is out now. Originally written by Sultana as a teenager, it’s one of the earliest songs in their catalogue — shaped by a love of artists like Jeff Buckley, Bon Iver, and, fittingly, City and Colour.

Now reimagined, the track reflects where Sultana is today – both as an artist and as someone approaching 30.

“That looming milestone makes you reflect,” Sultana says. “There’s this pressure that you’ve somehow ‘aged out’, but it’s all bullshit. 30’s young. Life’s only getting better. I wouldn’t relive my early 20s for anything – and that realisation bled straight into this song.”

The recording process wasn’t without levity. As final touches were being laid down, including bass guitar, an unexpected interruption came from Sultana’s dog. “Right as the bass kicked in, my dog went into the next room and did his business – the timing couldn’t have been funnier,” they recall. “It definitely lightened the mood. We were bonded.”

Dallas Green, aka City and Colour, adds: “Working with Tash was an absolute joy. We first connected last year and hit it off right away. That first impression led to me visiting their studio in Australia and eventually creating this song together. Tash is one of the most impressive people I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. Their passion and work ethic was inspiring. I’m truly grateful to have been invited to be a part of this.”

“Ain’t it Kinda Funny” follows earlier singles “Milk & Honey” and “Hold On”, all set to appear on the upcoming project, out Friday, May 30th.
