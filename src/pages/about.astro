          <h2 class="about-card-title">From Post-Hardcore to Intimate Folk</h2>
          <p class="about-card-text">
            Before City and Colour, Dallas Green was known as the vocalist and guitarist of the Canadian
            post-hardcore band Alexisonfire. City and Colour began as a personal outlet for quieter,
            more introspective songs that didn’t fit within the energy of a loud, aggressive band. The
            early recordings were shared online and quickly gained a loyal audience, drawn to the
            vulnerability and warmth of his acoustic arrangements.

          <h2 class="about-card-title">Songs About Distance, Loss and Hope</h2>
          <p class="about-card-text">
            Across albums such as <em>Sometimes</em>, <em>Bring Me Your Love</em> and
            <em>Little Hell</em>, City and Colour explores themes of distance, loss, mental health
            and hope. The project is characterised by emotionally honest lyrics, spacious
            instrumentation and melodies that feel both fragile and powerful. Many listeners relate
            to the sense of melancholy and comfort that often coexist in his songs.

          <h2 class="about-card-title">A Live Experience Built on Connection</h2>
          <p class="about-card-text">
            On stage, City and Colour performances are often intimate, even in large venues. The live
            arrangements highlight Green’s voice and guitar playing, while giving space for the band
            to re-interpret older songs. Storytelling, humour and quiet moments between tracks help
            build a sense of shared experience between the artist and the audience, which is a core
            part of the project’s appeal.
