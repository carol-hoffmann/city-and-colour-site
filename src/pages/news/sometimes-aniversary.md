City and Colour, acclaimed singer, songwriter and performer Dallas Green, will celebrate the 20th Anniversary of his debut Double Platinum-selling LP Sometimes with a special performance of the album at Budweiser Stage in Toronto on June 20, 2025. Originally planned for its 15th anniversary in 2020 but delayed due to the pandemic, this long-awaited event pays tribute to the record that launched Green’s solo career and one of Canada’s biggest independent labels, Dine Alone Records.

“When we released Sometimes 20 years ago, I could never have imagined the journey it would take me on,” reflects Green. “But more importantly, how deeply the songs would resonate with so many people. This night is a celebration of that connection and for everyone who has spent time with this record over the years. These songs became yours a long time ago. As always, thank you for listening.”

The show will notably be Green’s 12th performance at the iconic venue, the most for any Canadian artist with the exception of Blue Rodeo and OVO Festival, and the only independent artist to do so. Green also has the distinction of being one of a handful of Canadian artists to sell out two consecutive nights at the venue alongside Drake, The Tragically Hip, and Sarah McLachlan.
