I read about a collaboration between Tash Sultana and City and Colour, and I though it would be nice to post it here. They’re putting out a new EP called Return to the Roots, and the third single, “Ain’t It Kinda Funny,” is already out. Tash actually wrote this song when they were a teenager, so it’s one of their oldest pieces, inspired by artists like Jeff Buckley, Bon Iver, besided City and Colour.

The track has been reworked to reflect where Tash is now, getting close to 30 and dealing with all those thoughts that come with that age. They talked about how people act like you’re “aging out,” but they think that’s nonsense.

Dallas Green said he loved working with Tash and that they connected instantly when they first met. That eventually led him to their studio in Australia, where they created the song together.

“Ain’t It Kinda Funny” follows the earlier singles “Milk & Honey” and “Hold On,” and the full EP was released on May 30th.
